We cover Bayesian statistics from scratch, sampling  schemes, Markov Chains, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, Gibbs Sampling, Bayesian Econometrics for state-space models and linear and nonlinear filtering (Kalman/Particle Filter).  Lectures and exercises will be intertwined and we heaviliy rely on R and/or MATLAB.
